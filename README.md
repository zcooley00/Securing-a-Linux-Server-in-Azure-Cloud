# Securing-a-Linux-Server-in-Azure-Cloud
## Overview
In this lab, I created a Linux virtual server in Microsoft Azure and took steps to make it more secure. The goal was to learn how cloud servers work and how to protect them from common security risks.

I set up safe user access, limited how the server can be accessed remotely, reviewed what was running on the system, and added basic network protections. I also made sure the server receives security updates automatically.

This project highlights my growing experience with cloud technology, Linux systems, and cybersecurity as I work toward a Bachelor’s degree in Cloud and Network Engineering.
